				Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and all those still recovering
				from "The Hunger Games" heartbreaks, prepare yourselves for the one, the
				only, the man who has probably baked more virtual bread than anyone in
				cinema history... Josh Hutcherson!
			</h2>
			<p>
				Yes, that's right, the guy who somehow made us all believe that
				decorating cakes was a survival skill, and who had us rooting for a love
				triangle so intense it almost set fire to the entire Capitol. When he's
				not trying to outwit President Snow, Josh is just like the rest of
				us—except, you know, he starred in "Bridge to Terabithia" and made you
				cry for a week. Who can forget his groundbreaking role as Laser in "The
				Kids Are All Right," where he answered the age-old question: 'What
				happens when your moms track down the sperm donor?' Classic Josh.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, and let's not forget that time he time-traveled in "Future Man" on
				Hulu, because playing a teenage warrior in a dystopian world wasn’t
				enough for him. He also had to save the future from video game
				disasters, all while cracking jokes and looking like he’s late for gym
				class.
			</p>
			<p>
				Josh is the kind of actor who can jump from fighting genetically
				modified monkeys in “Journey to the Center of the Earth” to playing a
				miniature soldier in “Epic,” because when you’re Hutcherson, size is
				just a number. Also, if you need someone to emote so hard that you
				believe he’s genuinely considering how to hide from giant bees on a
				tropical island—look no further!
			</p>
			<p>
				In short, Josh Hutcherson is the small-town Kentucky kid who grew up to
				become a big-screen legend, blending action hero bravado with just
				enough awkward charm to remind you that, yes, this guy could also be
				your goofy next-door neighbor who you ask to dog-sit but end up baking
				cupcakes with. With a career spanning dragons, dystopias, and dangerous
				missions, there's literally no role he can’t handle—except maybe one
				where he has to reach the top shelf. But hey, we love him anyway! Now
				look at Josh Hutcherson in about. I would advise to press on the
				picture.
